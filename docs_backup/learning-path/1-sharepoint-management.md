# Understanding SharePoint Document Management

### Site Navigation

### What is SharePoint Document Management?

SharePoint is a **cloud-based collaboration platform** that enables teams to store, organize, and manage documents efficiently. Unlike traditional Windows File Servers, which rely on **lettered drives and deep folder structures**, SharePoint introduces a more flexible and metadata-driven approach to document organization.

SharePoint document management is built on three key components:

- **SharePoint Sites** â€“ Workspaces where departments or projects can store related documents.
- **Document Libraries** â€“ Storage locations within SharePoint Sites where documents are categorized and managed.
- **Metadata & Auto-Labeling** â€“ A way to classify and organize documents dynamically instead of relying on folder structures.

This shift requires **understanding new terminology and concepts** that will improve how records are managed.

### SharePoint vs. Windows File Server

| Feature | Windows File Server | SharePoint |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Storage Structure | Folder-based, static | Metadata-driven, dynamic |
| Access & Security | Requires manual permission setup | Granular access controls per document/site |
| Collaboration | Limited file sharing | Real-time editing and versioning |
| Retention & Compliance | Manual processes | Automated policies with Microsoft Purview |

ðŸ’¡ **By shifting to SharePoint, departments no longer need to rely on deep folder structures or confusing drive mappings. Instead, they can leverage metadata and automation to streamline records management.**

### The Challenge: Unstructured Legacy Records

One of the biggest hurdles in transitioning to structured document management is dealing with historical records. Over time, employees created personal folders to store work, leading to:

- **Scattered legacy records** sitting in shared drives "just in case."
- **Named personal folders** (e.g., "Joeâ€™s Folder") becoming an unofficial standard.
- **Siloed workspaces**, where employees saved files independently instead of collaborating.
- **Duplicate content** stored across multiple locations, making version control difficult.

To address these challenges, we must transition from **lettered drives** to SharePoint-based **Document Libraries** and adopt a more structured approach to storing, labeling, and retrieving records.
