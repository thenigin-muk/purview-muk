# Metadata: The Key to Smarter Records Organization

### What is Metadata?

Metadata is **“data about data”**—it provides descriptive information about a document, allowing for better organization and searchability.

Instead of relying on folder names, metadata classifies files using standardized attributes like:

- 📅 **Date Created** – When the document was added
- 🏢 **Department** – Which group owns the document
- 📑 **Document Type** – Policy, contract, invoice, report, etc.
- 🔐 **Security Level** – Public, confidential, restricted
- 📌 **Retention Label** – How long the document must be kept

### Why Metadata Matters

Have you ever needed to find a specific policy document related to your department? Do you know exactly where to look for an IT policy or an HR policy, or would you need to send an email asking someone else? These situations create unnecessary delays and interruptions in workflow, reducing overall efficiency.

Metadata allows users to **filter, sort, and search for documents dynamically**, rather than navigating through complex folder structures.

💡 **Example:** Instead of storing separate copies of city-wide policies in different department folders, all policies can exist in a single **City Policies Document Library** where users can filter by:

- "Policy Type: HR Policy, IT Policy, Finance Policy, etc."
- "Year: 2024"
- "Department: Human Resources, IT, Finance, etc."

This method improves searchability, reduces duplication, and ensures that everyone in the organization is accessing **the most up-to-date version** of a document without confusion.
