## Licensing Requirements
Microsoft 365 licensing determines which compliance features are available. **Key differences:**

| License | Features Available |
|---------|--------------------|
| M365 G3 | Basic retention policies, limited Purview features |
| M365 G5 | Advanced Purview compliance, AI-driven labeling, eDiscovery Premium |

## Key Considerations
- If using G3, **check which features require an upgrade to G5**.
- Ensure correct roles are assigned in Microsoft 365 Admin Center.

## Next Steps
- Follow the step-by-step instructions provided.
- Ensure all dependencies and configurations are in place.
- If encountering issues, refer to the [Troubleshooting Guide](10-troubleshooting.md).
