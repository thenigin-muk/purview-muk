Email communication often contains critical business records, including contracts, approvals, and legal correspondences. However, managing email retention manually can lead to **accidental deletions, clutter, and compliance risks**. Microsoft Purview extends **auto-labeling and retention policies to Outlook**, ensuring that:

- **Important emails are automatically classified** based on metadata.
- **Retention labels are applied consistently** to match SharePoint records.
- **Emails are stored or deleted in accordance with compliance policies.**

### How Auto-Labeling Works in Outlook

Microsoft Purview scans emails for **keywords, metadata, and sender/recipient details** to determine retention needs. For example, in the **City Contracts Document Library**, related emails can be automatically:

- Tagged with a **"Contract Correspondence"** label.
- Retained for **a set period** based on regulatory requirements.
- Linked to the appropriate **contract files in SharePoint** for reference.

### Example: Managing Contracts-Related Emails

Instead of manually sorting and saving contract-related emails, Purview ensures that:

- Any email discussing **contract terms, amendments, or approvals** is retained for compliance.
- Expired contracts trigger **email disposition actions**, ensuring old correspondence is handled properly.

By automating email retention, organizations **eliminate human error** and ensure that important records remain available when needed, reducing the risk of **compliance violations or misplaced information**.

Microsoft Purview extends auto-labeling beyond SharePoint to Outlook, ensuring that emails are:

- Automatically classified based on metadata and keywords.
- Assigned retention labels that match corresponding SharePoint records.
- Retained or deleted according to compliance requirements.
