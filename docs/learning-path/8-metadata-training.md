### **What is Metadata?**

Metadata describes documents, making them easier to organize, find, and manage. Proper metadata helps you quickly find the right document.

### **How to Access and Apply Metadata**

1. Verify your access to SharePoint libraries.
2. If you don't have access, contact your supervisor.

#### **Creating a Document Set**

- Navigate to the correct SharePoint library.
- Click **New ‚Üí Document Set**.
- Enter Document Set metadata clearly.
- Save the Document Set.

#### **Uploading Documents**

- Open the Document Set.
- Drag and drop files or click **Upload**.
- Fill in Document-level metadata carefully.

#### **Linking Documents**

- Link related Agenda Bills and Contracts if matches exist.

### **Actions When Unsure About Metadata**

#### üîç For City Council Meetings

- Agenda Bill Number: Open the document and look at the top. Usually labeled clearly as 'Agenda Bill ####'.
- Agenda Item Name: If folder name is unclear, open the PDF and use the 'Subject Title' at the top of the first page.
- Staff Lead: Check the document header or top sections for a clearly stated staff member's name.
- Example: Folder name unclear? Open the PDF file and use the clearly stated 'Subject Title' and 'Meeting Date' at the top.

#### üìë For Contracts

- Contract/Agreement: Standard terms with signatures for purchase or services.
- MOU (Memorandum of Understanding): Usually informal, describes an understanding or roles. Often involves no financial terms.
- Interlocal Agreement (ILA): Agreement clearly between government entities (cities, counties).
- Franchise Agreement: Related to utilities, cable, or other services provided by private companies.
- Grant: Clearly about receiving funding or financial assistance.
- If Unsure: Ask your supervisor or contact the City Clerk's Office.
