## Implementing SharePoint for Auto-Labeling & Retention

This implementation follows an **incremental approach**, where phases **1 through 3 are looped for each workflow within a department or division** rather than applied organization-wide all at once. This ensures staff are not overwhelmed with changes and can adapt as each workflow is introduced, refined, and optimized. Each workflow serves as a learning experience, making subsequent implementations smoother and more efficient.

### Phased Approach for Implementation

**Assessment & Planning**

- Identify record types within each department that require structured retention.
- Map existing file structures from the Windows File Server and SharePoint into logical Document Libraries.
- Define metadata fields that will drive organization, filtering, and retention policies.

**Creating Document Libraries & Metadata Structure**

- Work with departments to create Document Libraries aligned with workflows.
- Apply consistent metadata to enable structured filtering.
- Establish Document Sets where necessary to group related records logically.

**Configuring Retention Policies in Microsoft Purview**

- Define Retention Labels based on Disposition Authority Numbers (DANs).
- Implement auto-labeling rules to ensure records are classified automatically.
- Apply disposition workflows to trigger audits, approvals, and final actions on records.

**Training & Adoption**

- Train department leads and records managers on metadata usage, filtering, and retention policies.
- Conduct workshops on how email retention integrates with document management.
- Provide guidance on handling public records requests using Compliance Manager.

**Ongoing Management & Optimization**

- Regularly review retention policies and update DANs as regulations change.
- Ensure IT and Records Managers monitor compliance dashboards in Purview.
- Refine metadata and organization structures as new use cases emerge.

**By following these structured steps, the organization will transition seamlessly into a modern, automated records retention and compliance system, reducing administrative burden while ensuring compliance and accessibility.**
