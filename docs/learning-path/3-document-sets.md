# Document Sets: A Smarter Alternative to Folders

### What is a Document Set?

A **Document Set** in SharePoint is a specialized type of folder that groups related documents together while maintaining metadata consistency across all files within the set. Unlike traditional folders, Document Sets ensure that all associated documents share the same classification, retention policies, and search attributes.

### Why Document Sets Matter

Managing large numbers of contracts, policies, and agreements requires a structured approach to ensure that files are stored, accessed, and retained correctly. Instead of navigating multiple folders, Document Sets allow users to:

- Keep all related documents in **one logical container**.
- Automatically **inherit metadata** across all documents within the set.
- Improve **searchability** by filtering instead of manually sorting through folders.

ðŸ’¡ Example: City Contracts Document Library

Instead of each department storing contracts in separate locations, all city-wide contracts can be managed in a single **City Contracts Document Library**. Each contract would exist as a **Document Set**, containing all related files such as:

- The signed contract agreement.
- Amendments and modifications.
- Correspondence and approval documents.
- Supporting financial and legal documents.

Users can **filter contracts dynamically** without manually sorting through folders. For example, they can filter by:

- "Contracts where I am a key stakeholder."
- "Contracts expiring in the next 6 months."
- "Vendor name or contract type."

This method ensures that **all contracts remain in a single location**, and users can easily retrieve the documents most relevant to them at any given time.

A **Document Set** in SharePoint is similar to a folder but with key improvements:

- All documents in the set inherit the same metadata (classification, retention, etc.)
- Users can easily access related records in one place
