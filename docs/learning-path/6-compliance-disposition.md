In addition to managing retention and labeling, **Microsoft Purview Compliance Manager** provides tools for overseeing **public records requests, legal holds, and compliance audits**. This ensures that metadata-driven records management is **not just about retention but also about accessibility and legal accountability.**

When responding to a **public records request**, Purview allows users to:

- Identify all documents related to a **specific contract or policy**.
- Retrieve **all email correspondence** tied to a given project or agreement.
- Ensure that all associated files are reviewed, exported, or disclosed in a structured manner.

### Example: Public Records Requests & Legal Holds

Imagine a scenario where a **public records request** is submitted regarding a vendor contract. Instead of manually searching through disconnected folders and inboxes, Compliance Manager can:

- Aggregate **all related emails, documents, and approvals** into a single case.
- Apply **legal holds** to prevent deletion during the review process.
- Ensure **records remain intact** even if employees leave or change roles.

Microsoft Purview acts as the **banker’s box** of electronic records management—ensuring all documents are retained, discoverable, and **ready for audits or legal inquiries.**
