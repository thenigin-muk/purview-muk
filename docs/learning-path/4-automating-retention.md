# Automating Records Retention & Compliance

### What is Microsoft Purview?

Microsoft Purview is a **compliance and data governance platform** that integrates with SharePoint to help organizations **automate records retention, classification, and security policies**. By leveraging metadata, Purview ensures that records are stored, retained, and disposed of in accordance with legal and organizational policies.

### Why Automating Retention Matters

Manual retention processes require employees to remember when to archive or delete records, leading to inconsistencies and compliance risks. By automating retention with Microsoft Purview, organizations can:

- **Ensure consistent retention policies** across all departments.
- **Classify records automatically** based on metadata and content.
- **Lock finalized records** to prevent unauthorized modifications.
- **Ensure legal compliance** without relying on manual processes.

### Example: Retention in the City Contracts Document Library

With Microsoft Purview, the **City Contracts Document Library** can automatically enforce retention policies. For example:

- Contracts tagged with **"Active"** status are retained for reference.
- Contracts tagged as **"Expired"** automatically enter a disposition process.
- Key documents are **locked from modifications** once signed to preserve their legal integrity.

Instead of manually tracking contract expiration dates, Microsoft Purview enables **automated disposition actions** based on predefined retention schedules. Disposition refers to the process of reviewing records at the end of their retention period to determine whether they should be archived, deleted, or retained further based on compliance requirements.

### Understanding Electronic Dispositions in Records Management

Just like physical records require periodic review, such as storing essential documents in **bankers' boxes** for long-term archival or discarding temporary notes and post-its, digital records also undergo **disposition actions** based on their record type.

Microsoft Purview acts as the **digital equivalent of a structured disposition process**, ensuring that:

- Essential records are **archived** properly.
- Time-sensitive documents are **reviewed and approved before deletion**.
- Non-essential or obsolete files are **automatically disposed of**, reducing clutter and compliance risks.

By using metadata-driven retention, organizations **eliminate the need for manual file cleanup** and ensure that records are retained as long as required—without extra administrative overhead. Additionally, when the State revises Disposition Authority Numbers (DANs), IT can update these retention schedules and disposition actions in Microsoft Purview, ensuring compliance without requiring staff to manually review and adjust each document.

By using metadata-driven auto-labeling and Microsoft Purview, SharePoint can:

- Automatically classify records based on metadata
- Apply retention rules consistently across all departments
- Lock finalized records to prevent accidental changes
- Ensure compliance with legal & regulatory requirements
